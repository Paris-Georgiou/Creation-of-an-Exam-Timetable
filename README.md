# Creation-of-an-Exam-Timetable

This project was assigned during my Bachelors degree curriculum and it revolves around understanding the importance of Genetic Algorithms.

The program will take as in input the data we have stored in the files courses.txt, departments.txt, instructors.txt, rooms.txt, slots.txt and create a population of Exam Timetables. Then, it will evaluate all timetables and according to our set of rules it will determine the score for each one. If there is a timetable that has a high enough score, then the program will stop and it will print out the result. Otherwise, the program will slighty modify our current population in hope that it will create a better version of the previous population. This process will continue for a set amount of times or until the program manages to create a good enough Exam Timetable.
